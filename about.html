<p>Then after Dec,I wanted to be a programmer hence started surfing the youtube to search which programming language to learn first.
  Started learning few programming languages for a couple of days.I never knew which languages to learn .Influenced by youtube first tried C programming for couple of days.Then started learning Python programming.
  Again for couple of days. Tried learning SQL,Microsoft excel,HTML5,CSS etc.
  All the mentioned languages I tried learning for just a couple of days.
  Due to lack of consistency ,and didnot knew what was going on in my life.

<p>After wasting my 8months I joined ICICI Bank phone banking as a Team Leader on Sep,22.Again quit the job on Jan for learning programming language.
  Still after again wasting of 4 months here I am on the journey to be a Web Developer.
  Currently I am following Dr Yu Angela's course Udemy which I purchased last year.
